# A Comparative Evaluation of Animation and Small Multiples For Trend Visualization on Mobile Phones: Study Data + Analysis Scripts

Analyzing the results of an graphical perception study comparing animated and faceted bubble charts.

Maintained by [Matthew Brehmer](https://github.com/mattbrehmer).

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to this directory.

2. Ensure that [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is installed.

3. processCSVs.R will ingest log files as exported from [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/). If you wrote your own custom logging protocol for the StudyApp, you will need to modify processLogCSVs.R to match the format of your log files. 

4. In the R terminal, `> source(main.R)`, which will process the log files, compute (bootstrap) CIs for time and error, and export plots. Depending on how powerful your machine is, the bootstrap CI calculations may take a few minutes.

5. All of the .pdf charts will appear in this directory.
